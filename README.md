A website for Retro Video Game collectors. 
Includes consoles from Atari all the way up to the Gamecube/PlayStation2 generation.

Enjoy logging and navigating your inventory to the Outrun color stylings of the 80â€™s era.

Remind yourself of that glorious age of video games so difficult they bordered on unplayable (just kidding) and movies to the tune of Blade Runner or Alien.

Project created with PERN stack (Postgresql, Express, React, Node)

CSS drawn from scratch for full control over the aesthetics (with some slight help from SASS).
